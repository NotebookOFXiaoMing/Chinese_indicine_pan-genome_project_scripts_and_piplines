# Chinese indicine cattle pan-genome project

This repository contains custom scripts and pipelines to analyse Chinese indicine cattle project. Most of the scripts were specially designed to perform the analyses in the paper ```A Chinese indicine pan-genome reveals a wealth of novel structural variants introgressed from other Bos species```.

## Contents
The analysis pipelines and scripts of the five parts of the article are integrated into the following five folders, and each script has detailed code comments.

- [assembly and assessment](https://github.com/Xuelei-Dai/Chinese_indicine_pan-genome_project_scripts_and_piplines/tree/main/01.assembly_and_assessment)

* [multi-assembly graph construction](https://github.com/Xuelei-Dai/Chinese_indicine_pan-genome_project_scripts_and_piplines/tree/main/02.multi-assembly_graph_construction)

* [structural variants generating and characterizing](https://github.com/Xuelei-Dai/Chinese_indicine_pan-genome_project_scripts_and_piplines/tree/main/03.structural_variants_generating_and_characterizing)

* [archaic introgression and_admixture history analysis](https://github.com/Xuelei-Dai/Chinese_indicine_pan-genome_project_scripts_and_piplines/tree/main/04.archaic_introgression_and_admixture_history_analysis)

* [structural variants genotyping and adaptive introgression analysis](https://github.com/Xuelei-Dai/Chinese_indicine_pan-genome_project_scripts_and_piplines/tree/main/05.structural_variants_genotyping_and_adaptive_introgression_analysis)

Here is a brief description of the contents of each directory.

In addition, we provided a [testing protocol](https://github.com/Xuelei-Dai/Chinese_indicine_pan-genome_project_scripts_and_piplines/tree/main/02.multi-assembly_graph_construction/Minigraph_Cactus_graph) for pangenome graphs.
